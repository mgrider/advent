# advent of code

https://adventofcode.com/

All code by [Martin Grider](http://chesstris.com/) unless otherwise noted. But I cannot claim to have created all the algorithms. When the going gets tough, I'm not above chatting with other folks doing it to get ideas, or even (usually last resort 2am kind of thing) looking at other folks solutions.

I do this for fun, and when it stops feeling fun (sometimes it just feels like work), I stop.


## 2021

Decided to get organized and create a project file ahead of time.


## 2020

I started out trying to use swift playgrounds, but that only lasted 11 days. (And it's weirdly split between a single playground with multple pages for days 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10 & 11, and individual playgrounds for days 3-6.) Playgrounds was getting kinda crashy. So after day 11 I switched to a Swift CLI project.


## 2018

I only did like 3 days of 2018. No idea where the code went/lives, but it's probably in git somewhere. IIRC, I wanted to use python, and I've only ever done a few things in python, so that may have been a barrier.
